      In my free time apart from coding I learn Korean and I try to post
      regularly on my educational instagram blog about it (check it out -
      @kore.ania). I like to draw and learn new things, so I do yoga, skate,
      surf and try as many things as possible while maintaining a pretty simple
      and slow life of an introverted person.
